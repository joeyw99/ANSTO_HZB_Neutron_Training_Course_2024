# Structure relaxation

This is the first step in the phonon calculation. We need to relax the crystal structure to minimize the forces between atoms.
We will use the relaxed structure to calculate the phonons. Effectively, we will obtain the phonon vibrations at 0 K temperature.

## Ions position relaxation. 
First we will relax the ions positions. We need to change a couple of parameters in our input parameters file.
