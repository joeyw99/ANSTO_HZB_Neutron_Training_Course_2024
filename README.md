# ANSTO - HZB Neutron Training Course 2024 

The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB) Neutron Training Course 2024 aims to provide a broad overview of neutron scattering theory and applications to demonstrate the utility of the technique to a wide range of sciences. 

This repository contains the necessary files for the practical session in computational analysis (an introduction to DFT calculation with Quantum Espresso).

Each directory contains a README.md file with instructions and details about the stored files and scripts. 

## Getting Started

git clone repository 
```shell
git clone git@github.com:pablogalaviz/ANSTO_HZB_Neutron_Training_Course_2024 
cd ANSTO_HZB_Neutron_Training_Course_2024
```

### Prerequisites

To run the practicals during the training course, you need access to [Setonix](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/setonix/) (We will provide the login details during the course).

To run the practicals on your own HPC or server, you need to install Quantum Espresso. Follow the [installation instructions](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/user_guide/node7.html).
